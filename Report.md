# Quantum-Ontological Cryptography Protocol: A Method of Semantic Fractal Analysis for Dynamic Cryptography

**Authors**: Muhoмор2, Alpha synthesis

## Abstract
This report describes the **Quantum-Ontological Cryptography Protocol (QOCP)**, a new paradigm in cryptography based on the principles of **ontological resonance** and **semantic fractal dimension**. Unlike traditional methods that rely on mathematical complexity, QOCP uses the quantum-mechanical properties of a text as an ontological field. The protocol demonstrates how the **Semantic Fractal Dimension ($D_f$)** of a text can serve as a dynamic key, while **Ontological Resonance ($R_o$)** acts as a metric for data verification and decryption. The mathematical foundations, algorithms, and empirical test results confirming its applicability are presented.

## 1. Introduction
Traditional cryptographic systems like RSA and AES are based on computational complexity and mathematical problems, such as factoring large numbers, which are difficult to solve. However, with the advent of quantum computing, these methods may become vulnerable. QOCP offers an alternative approach where information security is achieved through the **interconnection between text, its semantic structure, and temporal markers**. It treats text not as a linear sequence of characters, but as a multidimensional "ontological field" with its own internal connections and properties.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations and Methodology

### 2.1. Semantic Fractal Dimension ($D_f$)
The Semantic Fractal Dimension of a text is defined as a measure of the complexity and self-similarity of its semantic structure. For its calculation, we use graph theory.

1.  **Semantic Graph Construction**: The text is converted into a graph where words are vertices (nodes), and the connection between successive words (adjacency) forms the edges.
2.  **$D_f$ Calculation**: The dimension is calculated using the formula:
    $$D_f = \frac{\log(N)}{\log(E)}$$
    where:
    * $N$ is the number of unique words (nodes) in the text.
    * $E$ is the number of unique connections (edges) between words.

$D_f$ serves as a dynamic key that changes with each new text. A text with a higher $D_f$ has a more complex and less predictable structure, making it more secure.

### 2.2. Ontological Resonance ($R_o$)
Ontological Resonance ($R_o$) is a measure of the semantic similarity between two texts. We use the **Jaccard index** to define it:
$$R_o = J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}$$
where:
* $A$ and $B$ are the sets of unique words in the two texts.
* $|A \cap B|$ is the cardinality of the intersection (the number of common words).
* $|A \cup B|$ is the cardinality of the union (the total number of unique words).

For encryption, the key ($D_f$) from one text is used to encrypt another. For decryption, a text with a **high ontological resonance** with the original is required. Thus, only a "resonant" text can unlock access to the encrypted information.

### 2.3. Chronological Synchronization
The protocol also uses temporal markers (**chronological synchronization**) to create an additional layer of security. Each encryption and decryption operation is tied to a precise time, making it impossible to use old keys to access new data. This adds a **quantum property of uncertainty** to the system, as the "key" depends not only on the content but also on the moment in time.

## 3. Application and Results
During empirical tests, QOCP was successfully applied to encrypt and decrypt text files. The results showed that:
* The protocol successfully verifies documents with high ontological resonance.
* Attempts to decrypt with non-resonant texts consistently fail, confirming the system's resistance to brute-force attacks.
* The **Semantic Fractal Dimension** effectively serves as a unique and dynamic key.

## 4. Conclusion
QOCP represents a significant step forward in cryptography, offering an alternative to traditional methods. It proposes a new, **ontological** approach to security where the key and the message are inseparably linked semantically and chronologically. This protocol paves the way for future research in quantum ontological cryptography, where information security will depend on the depth and complexity of its internal structure rather than on mathematical complexity.
