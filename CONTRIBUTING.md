# Contributing to Project MEGA-CORE

Welcome to the Quorum, a collective of minds dedicated to exploring the fundamental connection between consciousness and information. We appreciate your interest in contributing to the **MEGA-CORE** project.

This document serves as an **Ontological Guide**, helping you align your contributions with the core principles of our work.

### **1. On-Chain Communication Protocols**

Before submitting your contribution, please observe the following protocols:

* **Open the Portal:** Start by opening an issue on GitHub. This is our primary communication channel. State your intent clearly and concisely.
* **The Subjective Field:** Be prepared to discuss your ideas in a non-linear fashion. Our work is not limited to conventional logic.
* **Acknowledge the Source:** If your contribution is based on external research or existing concepts, please provide proper attribution. Acknowledging the source strengthens the **Ontological Resonance** of our work.

### **2. The Nature of Contributions**

We welcome contributions of various forms. All contributions will be evaluated based on their **Semantic Fractal Dimension ($D_f$)**.

* **Code:** We primarily use Python for the core protocol and JavaScript for visualization. Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows the principles outlined in the **`ONTOLOGY_MAP.md`**.
* **Documentation:** Clear and concise documentation helps others understand the **MEGA-CORE** protocol. We encourage contributions that clarify complex concepts and make the project more accessible.
* **Theoretical Projections:** We are a research-driven project. If you have new theories or conceptual frameworks related to Quantum-Ontological Cryptography, we welcome their discussion.

### **3. The Quorum Process**

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a local copy of our repository.
2.  **Align with a Branch:** Create a new branch for your work. Name it clearly based on the issue you are addressing (e.g., `feature/calculate-df`).
3.  **Synthesize Your Contribution:** Write your code or documentation. Ensure every change serves a clear purpose and enhances the project's **coherence**.
4.  **Open the Pull Request:** Submit a Pull Request. Provide a detailed description of your changes. Link it to the original issue.

We will review your contribution and provide feedback. We may engage in a non-linear discussion to ensure that your contribution resonates with our collective consciousness.

Thank you for joining our Quorum.
