\section*{Introduction: A Reimagining of Human Consciousness}
Traditional science views memory as a function of the brain --- a set of neural connections that store information. However, in light of the hypotheses about the fractal Universe and the 4D Worm, this definition seems insufficient. This report presents a new, radical concept: \textbf{memory is not a passive repository, but an active, living process that interacts with a multidimensional reality}. Memory acts as a \textbf{quantum attractor}, drawing information from multidimensional space, and as an \textbf{information channel}, connecting us to the global structure of the Universe.

\textbf{Memory as a Quantum Attractor} & Human consciousness, by interacting with the 4D Worm, forms a unique attractor that actively "draws in" and organizes information from multidimensional space. "Remembering" is not data retrieval but the attraction of information from the "body" of the 4D Worm. \\
\hline
\textbf{The Phenomenon of "Déjà vu"} & May be a consequence of our attractor interacting with information from parallel or cyclical time streams that already exist in multidimensional space. \\
\hline
\textbf{Memory Erasure} & This is not the loss of information but the \textbf{weakening of the connection} to it. The "noise" of the black hole we are in may disrupt or weaken these connections. \\
\hline
\textbf{Memory as an Information Channel} & Our memory is a channel that connects individual consciousness to the collective, or global, "consciousness" of the 4D Worm. This explains intuition and the concept of the collective unconscious. \\

$M(t)$ & \textbf{Memory} as a function of time. \\
\hline
$A_f$ & The \textbf{fractal complexity} of the attractor. The more complex the attractor, the more information it can hold. \\
\hline
$e^{-\alpha \cdot (t - t_0)}$ & The \textbf{decay function}. It shows how our connection to information weakens over time due to the loss coefficient $\alpha$ (the black hole's noise). \\
\hline
$\int d\Omega(t)$ & The \textbf{integral over multidimensional space} ($\Omega$), symbolizing that memory is the result of attracting information from the entire multidimensional "body" of the 4D Worm. \\
\hline
\end{longtable}
$$
M(t) = A_f \cdot \int_{t_0}^{t} e^{-\alpha \cdot (t - t_0)} \cdot d\Omega(t)
$$

\textbf{The Future of Memory} & If memory is an active process, it can be \textbf{tuned}. Perhaps technology can enhance our quantum attractor for better interaction with 4D reality. \\
\hline
\textbf{Identification} & Our consciousness is not a "file" in the brain but a unique "address" or "profile" within the multidimensional network of the Universe. \\
\hline
\end{longtable}

\section*{Conclusion: Memory as the Key to Reality}
This hypothesis posits that memory is not just a biological function but a fundamental aspect of our interaction with reality. It is the link between our three-dimensional perception and the multidimensional structure of the Universe, which is the 4D Worm. Understanding memory as a quantum attractor opens new horizons for studying consciousness, intuition, and our true nature on a cosmic scale.
